                            The Control Office Application requires the controllers to enter data related to the train operations as they receive information from the control points or stations. The key features of the application include the ability of the controller to order trains, view all possible routes, divert or re-route trains, if required. The application has the facility for capturing and viewing details of consist or composition of the train, details of the crew and locomotive. Reporting of unusual events is enabled through the user friendly interface. There is also a chart that shows details of line occupancy, caution orders, and abnormal working. One of the key elements of the application is the ability to forecast or extrapolate the running of trains which allows the controller to plan better. COA has been designed to facilitate its integration with any other application.

                        The Control Office Application requires the controllers to enter data related to the train operations as they receive information from the control points or stations.  The application charts the running of the train in a section (a portion of the divisional network) and also generates the advance forecast based on various operational parameters.  The train is then virtually handed over to the adjacent division as per its physical movement to maintain continuous flow of information. The key features of the application include the ability of the controller to order trains, view all possible routes, divert or re-route trains, if required. The application has the facility for capturing and viewing details of consist or composition of the train,  details of the crew and locomotive.  Reporting of unusual events is enabled through the user friendly interface. There is also a chart that shows details of line occupancy, caution orders, and abnormal working. For managerial supervision the charts can be printed apart from the fact that structured MIS reports are also generated. COA has been designed to facilitate its integration with any other application.
